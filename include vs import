include_role vs import_role
========================

way of calling other roles.

import_role respects the tags. if you apply the tages to import_role those will be automatically 
applied to all the tasks inside that role.

include_role does not respect the tags.

import_roles parse the playbook before execution, it is static.
include_roles is dynamic. it will directly execute the playboo. it will not parse like import_roles before execution.

conditions applied to import_role is applied to all the tasks
include_role will not care the condition applied to it.

You cannot use loops on 'import_role' statements. You should use 'include_role' instead.
